# Perplexed Horse – Organisation Defaults

This repository contains organisation-wide GitHub configuration files for the Perplexed Horse organisation.

The files in this repository are automatically applied to all repositories within the organisation unless explicitly overridden at the repository level.

- Set community standards
- Provide consistent issue and pull request workflows

It does not contain project code, designs, or documentation.

  Organisation-wide contribution guidelines for all Perplexed Horse projects.

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`  
  Community behaviour standards, adapted from the Contributor Covenant.

Additional files (such as issue templates or pull request templates) may be added over time.

---

## Scope

These defaults apply to:

## Notes for Maintainers

If a repository requires behaviour or contribution rules that differ from these defaults, it may include its own local files to override the organisation-wide versions.
