# Contributing to Perplexed Horse

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Perplexed Horse**.

Perplexed Horse is an open hardware project focused on compact, mechanically simple solutions for 3D printing. The project is actively developed and published in a transparent manner, with an emphasis on clear scope and controlled iteration.

## Contribution Model

At this stage of the project, **design ownership and implementation decisions are centrally maintained** by the project author.

This approach helps ensure:

- Consistent design philosophy across repositories
- Controlled mechanical tolerances and interfaces
- Clear documentation and traceability as designs evolve

This does **not** mean contributions are unwelcome—quite the opposite.

## How You Can Contribute

The most valuable contributions right now are:

### ✔ Testing and Validation

- Build and use the designs
- Report fit, tolerance, or wear issues
- Test across different printers, filaments, and environments

### ✔ Feedback and Suggestions

- Share observations from real-world use
- Suggest improvements or alternatives
- Identify unclear documentation or missing details

### ✔ Issue Reports

When opening an issue, please include:

- Which project and revision you are using
- Your printer model and setup
- Filament types used
- Photos or videos where relevant
- Clear reproduction steps if reporting a problem

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are **generally not expected for design changes** at this time.

If you believe a change is necessary:

- Please open an issue first
- Describe the problem and proposed approach
- Discussion will help determine whether and how the change should be incorporated

Documentation improvements and corrections may be accepted on a case-by-case basis.

## Design Philosophy

Before suggesting changes, please familiarise yourself with the project’s design goals and scope as described in each repository’s README.

Suggestions that align with the existing philosophy and constraints are far more likely to be considered.

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.  
Perplexed Horse is intended to be a collaborative and welcoming project, even while design decisions remain centrally managed.

## Thank You

Your testing, feedback, and ideas help improve the quality and robustness of Perplexed Horse projects, and are genuinely appreciated.
